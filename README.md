Contact Management System
This is a Contact Management System built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. It allows users to manage contacts by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The backend uses a MongoDB database to store the contact information.

Features
Add a Contact: Add a new contact with details such as first name, last name, email, phone number, company, and job title.
View Contacts: View a list of all the contacts.
Edit a Contact: Update an existing contact's information.
Delete a Contact: Delete a contact from the system.

MongoDB database is used

Note: the files for frontend are explicitly attached as there was a problem uploading frontend folder.
